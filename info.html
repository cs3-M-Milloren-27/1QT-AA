            The Philipine Eagle also known as the monkey-eating eagle or great Philippine eagle, is a critically endangered species of eagle of the family Accipitridae which is endemic to forests in the Philippines. It has brown and white-colored plumage, a shaggy crest, and generally measures 86 to 102 cm.

            The Philippine eagle is considered the largest of the extant eagles in the world in terms of length and wing surface area, with only Steller's sea eagle and the Harpy eagle being larger in terms of weight and bulk. It has been declared the national bird of the Philippines. The most significant threat to the species is loss of habitat, a result of high levels of deforestation throughout most of its range.

            The Philippine eagle was officially declared the national bird of the Philippines on July 4, 1995, by President Fidel V. Ramos. Due to the eagleâ€™s size and rarity, it is also a coveted species for birdwatchers. Killing a Philippine eagle is a criminal offence, punishable by law with up to 12 years imprisonment and heavy fines.
